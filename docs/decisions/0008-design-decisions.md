# Design Decisions

## Context and Problem Statement

Software Design Decision

## Considered Options

* KISS / DRY
* Big Design Up Front

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "KISS / DRY", because Keep It Simple and Stupid, and Don't Repeat Yourself, when writing code, strive for simplicity and clarity. Avoid incorporating complex logic or difficult-to-read segments within a single function. Instead, break down any complex algorithms into smaller, manageable functions. Ensured each function addresses a specific part of the algorithm and is named descriptively. Clear naming will help others understand the purpose of each function at a glance, facilitating easier maintenance and review.
