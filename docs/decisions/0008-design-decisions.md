# Design Decisions

## Context and Problem Statement

Software Design Decision

## Considered Options

* KISS
* Big Design Up Front


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "KISS", because Keep It Simple and Stupid When writing code, strive for simplicity and clarity. Avoid incorporating complex logic or difficult-to-read segments within a single function. Instead, break down any complex algorithms into smaller, manageable functions. Ensure each function addresses a specific part of the algorithm and is named descriptively. Clear naming will help others understand the purpose of each function at a glance, facilitating easier maintenance and review.
