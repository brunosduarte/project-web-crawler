# Patterns

## Context and Problem Statement

Classes VS Functions

## Considered Options

* Classes
* Functions

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Classes", because for the back-end the concept of classes in inherit, and was used the principles/patterns of S.O.L.I.D. in the most part of it. For the front-end the pattern used was the Functional instead.
