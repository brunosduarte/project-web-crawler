# Patterns

## Context and Problem Statement

Classes VS Functions

## Considered Options

* Classes
* Functions

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Classes", because Classes offer the robust structure and design capabilities needed for the complex logic and data handling typical of server-side applications, and was used the principles/patterns of S.O.L.I.D. in most part of it. In contrast, Functions provide a lighter, more modular, and flexible approach suitable for the dynamic and component-driven nature of front-end development.
