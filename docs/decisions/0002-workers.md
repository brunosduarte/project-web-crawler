# Workers

## Context and Problem Statement

Consuming items of the queue

## Considered Options

* Iteration
* Recursion

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Iteration", because The choice of iteration for consuming items from a queue, especially when using worker threads for parallel processing, is justified by the need for efficiency, scalability, and effective resource management. Iteration offers a more stable and performance-oriented approach compared to recursion, particularly in environments where the queue might experience heavy loads or require fast processing. This makes iteration not only a suitable choice but also a strategic one in scenarios demanding high performance and reliability.
