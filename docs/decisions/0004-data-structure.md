# Data Structure

## Context and Problem Statement

How to present results properly?

## Considered Options

* Tree
* List

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Tree", because Initially, I implemented a method to display results as an ASCII list of links, organized by page dependencies. However, I envisioned the data structured more intuitively as a tree. This mismatch led me to attempt visualizing the results in a tree format using Node.js, but the process proved challenging, particularly in achieving a visually appealing output. At this juncture, I decided to shift focus towards developing a front-end interface. This approach aims to present the data more effectively and align with my original vision of a tree-structured display.
