# Validation

## Context and Problem Statement

Control the Items Eligible for Addition to the Queue

## Considered Options

* Validation
* Just put on the Queue

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Validation", because To effectively manage various edge cases, it was necessary to implement robust validation and sanitization processes. These measures address challenges such as broken links, infinite scroll and pagination, duplicate content, redirection loops, and the presence of binary and data files. Additionally, these processes ensure that activity is restricted to the main domain, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of operations.
