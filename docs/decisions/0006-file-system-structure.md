# File System Structure

## Context and Problem Statement

How to organize the files and structure folders?

## Considered Options

* Clean Architecture
* MVC

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Clean Architecture", because The choice for Clean Architecture for structuring a projectâ€™s files and folders provides clear, long-term benefits in terms of system maintainability, flexibility, and scalability. This architecture supports a more granular level of modularity and decoupling than MVC, making it better suited for complex or large-scale applications where future modifications, testing, and expansions are anticipated.
