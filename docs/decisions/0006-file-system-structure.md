* Clean Architecture

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Clean Architecture", because Organizing your codebase is crucial for maintaining a modular architecture. A well-structured folder hierarchy enhances code readability and discoverability. Each module should have a clear and distinct purpose, encapsulating related functions and components.
For instance, you might organize your codebase into folders like “controllers,” “services,” “models,” and “routes.” These folders correspond to different layers of your application, providing a clean separation of concerns.
